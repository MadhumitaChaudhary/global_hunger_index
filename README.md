This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) data. The GHI is a tool designed to comprehensively measure and track hunger at the global, regional, and national levels. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omarsobhy14/global-hunger-index)

## Project Overview

The analysis includes:

- Trends in GHI over time
- Distribution of GHI across different countries and regions
- Severity of hunger over time and across different countries and regions
- Cluster analysis grouping countries based on their GHI and severity
- Spotlight on countries and regions with notable GHI scores and improvements

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Global Hunger Index data, which includes the GHI scores for different countries over several years, along with the severity of hunger. 

### Data Dictionary

- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Region`: The region in which the country is located.
- `GHI_Score<Year>`: The Global Hunger Index score for the country in the given year.
- `Severity_Scale<Year>`: The severity of hunger in the country in the given year, categorized as 'Low', 'Moderate', 'Serious', 'Alarming', or 'Extremely Alarming'.

## Analysis

The analysis was performed using Python, with libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for cluster analysis.

## Key Findings

The key findings from the analysis are summarized in the report. These include trends in GHI over time, distribution of GHI across countries and regions, severity of hunger, and cluster analysis results.
